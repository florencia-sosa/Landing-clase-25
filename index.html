        <h3>What they say</h3>
        <p class="p1">
          Playphone integration has been easy with its
          simple SDK and we've been able to leverage its
          real-time dashboard to show results immediately.
          Playphone's support team is very efficient and is
          always available with answers and advice.
          Because of our Leaderboard integration we are
          seeing strong revenue conversion %'s.
